**AlreadyFound** is a search bookmarklet. Have you ever queried Google for something, and eventually found the answer in your bookmarks? Instead of searching Google first, use **AlreadyFound** to simultaneously search Google and your favorite bookmarking service!!!

### Services supported ###
*   [Delicious](http://www.delicious.com/) 
*   [Google Bookmarks](http://www.google.com/bookmarks/)
