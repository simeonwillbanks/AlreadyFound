INTRODUCTION
============
**AlreadyFound** is a search bookmarklet. Have you ever queried Google for something, and eventually found the answer in your bookmarks? Instead of searching Google first, use **AlreadyFound** to simultaneously search Google and your Delicious bookmarks!!!

Thanks to [Mitch Matuson](http://github.com/mmatuson) for inspiration.

INSTALLATION
------------  
1.  Visit the [generator site](http://alreadyfound.heroku.com/ "Build your personalized Already Found Bookmarklet")
2.  Set your preferences and Delicious username
3.  Submit the form
4.  Drag the Bookmarklet to your Bookmarks Bar!!!

**Note:** Out of the box, Internet Explorer doesn't support JavaScript's `prompt()` method. Therefore, **AlreadyFound** will only work in standards-compliant browsers like Safari, Firefox or Chrome.

USAGE
---- 
Click the bookmarklet and enter your query. Alternatively, you can select your queries text and click the bookmarklet. You may choose either Delicious or Google to render in the parent window. In a new window, the opposite will render.
